üìò AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

1. Cloud Concepts
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  -Example: Deploying a Windows VM to host a web app.
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.
  - Example: Hosting a .NET app on Azure App Service.
- SaaS (Software as a Service): Delivers software applications online.
  - Example: Using Microsoft 365 for productivity.
- CapEx vs OpEx: CapEx is upfront investment (e.g., buying servers); OpEx is pay-as-you-go (e.g., Azure).
- Benefits: High Availability (99.9% uptime), Scalability (scale out/in), Fault Tolerance (auto-redundancy), Disaster Recovery (geo-redundant storage).
- Cloud Models: 
  - Public: Azure
  - Private: On-prem cloud like Hyper-V
  - Hybrid: Mix of both for flexibility

2. Core Azure Services
- Compute: VMs (Windows/Linux), App Services (web hosting), Functions (event-driven), AKS (Kubernetes)
  - Scenario: Host an API on Azure Functions for dynamic scaling.
- Networking: VNet (isolate network), NSG (traffic rules), Load Balancer (distribute traffic), VPN Gateway (secure connection)
  - Scenario: Connect on-prem to Azure via VPN.
 Storage: Blob (unstructured data), File (SMB shares), Queue (message queue), Disk (VM storage)
   Scenario: Store images in Blob storage for a web app.
- Databases: Azure SQL (relational), Cosmos DB (NoSQL)
  - Scenario: Use Cosmos DB for a globally distributed app.

3. Core Solutions & Management Tools
- Tools: Azure Portal (GUI), CLI (command line), PowerShell (scripts), ARM Templates (infra-as-code)
- Management: Azure Monitor (logs/metrics), Advisor (recommendations), Resource Manager (resource deployment)
  - Scenario: Use ARM to deploy identical environments in dev and prod.

4. Security, Privacy, Compliance
- Security Tools: Azure AD (identity), MFA (multi-factor), RBAC (role access), Key Vault (secret storage), Azure Firewall
- Compliance: Trust Center lists Azure certifications and data regulations
  - Scenario: Restrict app access using RBAC and enforce MFA for admins.

5. Pricing & Support
- Tools: Pricing Calculator (estimate cost), TCO Calculator (compare on-prem vs cloud)
- Support Plans: Vary by needs (Basic ‚Üí Professional Direct)
- SLAs: Guarantees like 99.9% uptime; defines service availability
  - Scenario: Choose Standard support for 24x7 business-critical workloads.

üìó AZ-104: Azure Administrator Associate

1. Manage Azure Identities and Governance
- Azure AD: Central directory for users, devices, and roles
  - Scenario: Grant an intern reader-only access to a resource group.
- RBAC: Assign permissions to users or groups using predefined/custom roles
- Governance: Tags (cost mgmt), Policy (enforce rules), Management Groups (group subs)

2. Implement and Manage Storage
- Blob/File/Table/Queue: Choose based on workload (e.g., Blob for media, File for shared drives)
- Access Control: Keys, SAS tokens, and Azure AD-based access
- Lifecycle Management: Automatically move blobs to cool/archive tiers
  - Scenario: Automatically archive logs older than 30 days.

3. Deploy and Manage Azure Compute Resources
- VMs: Create, scale, automate via ARM
- App Services: Host web apps with autoscale and staging slots
- Security: Bastion (secure RDP/SSH), Extensions (run scripts)
  -Scenario: Use Custom Script Extension to install IIS on VM post-deployment.

4. Configure and Manage Virtual Networks
- VNet: Create isolated networks
- Subnets/NSGs: Secure and control traffic
- VNet Peering: Connect networks without VPN
- ExpressRoute: Private link to Azure
  - Scenario: Set up secure communication between two Azure VNets across regions.

5. Monitor and Back Up Azure Resources
- Monitor: Metrics, logs, alerts
- Log Analytics: Query logs using KQL
- Recovery Services Vault: Backups, Site Recovery
  - Scenario: Back up VMs daily and enable site recovery for DR.

AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)

1. Cloud Concepts
- Benefits: Elasticity (scale on demand), Agility (rapid deployment), Cost-effectiveness (pay-as-you-go)
- Global Infra: AWS Regions (geographical), AZs (redundancy), Edge Locations (CDN)
- Cloud Models: 
  - IaaS: EC2
  - PaaS: Elastic Beanstalk
  - SaaS: Amazon Chime

2. Core AWS Services
- Compute: EC2 (VMs), Lambda (serverless), Beanstalk (PaaS)
  - Scenario: Use Lambda to resize images on upload.
- Storage: S3 (object), EBS (block), Glacier (archival)
- Networking: VPC (network isolation), Route 53 (DNS), ELB (load balancing)
  - Scenario: Host static website on S3 + Route 53 for custom domain.
- Databases: RDS (managed SQL), DynamoDB (NoSQL)

3. Security and Compliance
- IAM: Create users, assign policies, use MFA
- Security Tools: Shield (DDoS), WAF (web filter), GuardDuty (threat detection), KMS (encryption)
- Compliance: AWS handles infra security, customer handles data/apps (Shared Model)

4. Billing and Pricing
- Free Tier: Try services free (e.g., 750 hrs EC2/month)
- Billing Tools: Cost Explorer (visualize), Budgets (set alerts), TCO Calculator
- Support Plans: Basic (free), Developer, Business, Enterprise

5. Cloud Architecture Principles
- Well-Architected Framework:
  - Operational Excellence: automate changes, monitor systems
  - Security: implement least privilege, protect data
  - Reliability: recovery and fault tolerance
  - Performance Efficiency: choose the right resources
  - Cost Optimization: avoid overprovisioning
  - Scenario: Design a 3-tier web app using ELB, EC2, and RDS with Auto Scaling and CloudWatch alerts
